# 3rd Party Tracer

## About

A client-side web application for discovering and analyzing third-party services associated with any domain through comprehensive DNS analysis. Built for security professionals to identify cloud service dependencies, detect subdomain takeovers, and assess an organization's digital footprint in real-time. 

The tool features automated detection of third-party services across cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), email security services, CDNs, and more. It includes security analysis for subdomain takeover detection, internal IP exposure identification, and DMARC policy assessment. All analysis happens directly in your browser - no data ever leaves your machine.
