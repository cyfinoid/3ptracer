**3rd Party Tracer** is a powerful client-side web application that analyzes DNS records to identify third-party services associated with any domain. Built with pure HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, it provides comprehensive insights into an organization's digital footprint and cloud service dependencies.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 **Comprehensive DNS Analysis**
- **DoH (DNS over HTTPS)** queries using Google and Cloudflare DNS servers
- **Multiple DNS record types**: A, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS, SPF, DMARC
- **Certificate Transparency logs** via crt.sh and Cert Spotter
- **Threat intelligence** integration with OTX AlienVault and HackerTarget

### 🏢 **Service Detection & Classification**
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr
- **Email Services**: ProofPoint, Mimecast, Barracuda, Sophos
- **CDN & Hosting**: Cloudflare, Firebase, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages
- **DNS Services**: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Route53
- **Security Services**: Various email security and threat protection providers

### 🔒 **Security Analysis**
- **Subdomain takeover detection** via CNAME resolution checks
- **DMARC policy analysis** with detailed policy parsing
- **Security issue categorization** by severity (High, Medium, Low)
- **Infrastructure risk assessment** based on IP ranges and ASN data

### 📊 **Rich Data Visualization**
- **Service categorization** with detailed descriptions
- **Historical subdomain records** with discovery source tracking
- **CNAME mapping visualization** showing service relationships
- **Statistics dashboard** with comprehensive metrics
- **Hyperlinked subdomains** for easy navigation

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **DNS**: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) with multiple providers
- **APIs**: Certificate Transparency, Threat Intelligence, ASN Lookup
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, no server dependencies
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages ready

## 📋 How It Works

### 1. **DNS Record Analysis**
The tool starts by querying various DNS record types:
- **TXT records** reveal service ownership proofs and configurations
- **SPF records** identify authorized email service providers
- **DMARC records** show email security and reporting services
- **MX records** indicate email hosting providers

### 2. **Subdomain Discovery**
Leverages multiple sources for comprehensive subdomain enumeration:
- **Certificate Transparency logs** via crt.sh and Cert Spotter
- **Threat intelligence platforms** like OTX AlienVault
- **DNS enumeration APIs** for additional coverage

### 3. **Service Classification**
Each discovered subdomain is analyzed and categorized:
- **IP-based classification** using ASN data from ipinfo.io
- **CNAME target analysis** for service identification
- **Pattern matching** against known service providers
- **Vendor consolidation** to prevent duplicate entries

### 4. **Security Assessment**
Comprehensive security analysis including:
- **Subdomain takeover detection** via CNAME resolution
- **DMARC policy evaluation** with detailed tag parsing
- **Infrastructure risk assessment** based on IP ranges
- **Cloud service dependency mapping**
