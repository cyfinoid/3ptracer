I wanted to give user a capability to see raw DNS records in Zone file format corresponding to the domain provided. 

Example table below:

| Host Label | TTL | Record Type | Record Data |
| example.com.| 60 |  A  | 104.255.228.125 | 


This should be made available as a collapse div after the scan is finished. 
Allow user to open the div by clicking.
